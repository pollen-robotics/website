upon receipt by electronic or postal mail of the estimate duly
dated and signed. Pollen Robotics reserves the right to cancel any
order from a customer in case of suspicion of fraud.</p><p>The information given by the buyer when taking the order is
binding on the latter. In case of error or incomplete information
in the wording of the addressee&rsquo;s details, Pollen Robotics cannot
be held responsible for the impossibility to make the delivery
within the delays indicated at the time of the order.</p><p>In the case of litigation in progress and out of payment - such as
late delivery, quality of the delivered product, the company
Pollen Robotics can be brought to revise with the customer the
conditions of the treatment of a new order.</p><p>By returning the signed quotation, which is valid for validation

Conditions of Sale in full and without reserve, as well as the
terms of payment appearing on the quotation. Any arrangement or
special clause of the customer that does not comply with these
General Terms and Conditions of Sale shall only be binding for the

writing.</p><h2 id=5-invoicing-and-payment>5. Invoicing and Payment</h2><p>According to the terms of payment indicated on the quotation, the
customer undertakes to pay for the order in two instalments: 30%
